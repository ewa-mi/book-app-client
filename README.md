# BOOK APP :book:


## INTRO

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Ewa, and this is my portfolio project - web application called The Book App. Please notice, this is MVP, not a final version. I implemented the most important features, [the other ones](https://github.com/users/ewa-mi/projects/1) will be added in the future. 

## THE BOOK APP

...is dedicated to book lovers, who want to have an overview of books they already read. As a user of The Book App you can create your books collections, rate books and write reviews and share your opinions with the world. Moreover, you can follow literary news and book recommendations.
